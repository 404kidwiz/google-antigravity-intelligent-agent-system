# 📖 User Guide - Intelligent Agent System

## 🎯 How It Works

Your Antigravity is now a **full SaaS development agency** with automatic expert detection. Just describe what you need - perfect expert appears instantly!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Test Your Installation
Start Antigravity and ask:
```
"Are global rules applied?"
"What experts are available?"
```

You should see confirmation of the intelligent agent system.

### 2. Start Using - No Setup Needed!
Just talk normally - experts appear automatically:

```
You: "How do I build a React form?"
System: [react-expert responds automatically]
```

## 💬 Conversation Examples

### Single Expert Requests
**Frontend Development:**
```
You: "Create a React dashboard with charts"
Response: [react-expert] "I'll build a responsive dashboard with Chart.js..."
```

**Backend Development:**
```
You: "I need a Python API for user management"
Response: [python-expert] "I'll create a FastAPI with SQLAlchemy models..."
```

**DevOps & Deployment:**
```
You: "How do I deploy this to production?"
Response: [docker-expert] "I'll containerize and deploy to Kubernetes..."
```

### Multi-Domain Projects
**SaaS Platform Development:**
```
You: "Build a project management SaaS with real-time updates"
Response: [backend-architect coordinates multiple experts]
"I'll architect this as a complete SaaS solution:
- Backend: Node.js microservices with WebSocket support
- Frontend: React with real-time collaboration features
- Database: PostgreSQL optimized for concurrent access
- Deployment: Docker containers on Kubernetes..."
```

**E-commerce Platform:**
```
You: "Add payment processing to my online store"
Response: [stripe-expert + security-expert coordination]
"I'll integrate Stripe payments with secure authentication..."
```

### Conversation Evolution
**Task Progression:**
```
You: "Create a React component"
System: [react-expert] "Here's your component..."

You: "Now I need a backend API for it"
System: [switches to python-expert] "I'll create the API endpoint..."

You: "How do I test this?"
System: [switches to jest-expert] "Let me write comprehensive tests..."
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Technology
**Good:**
```
"Create a React form with TypeScript validation"
"Build a Python FastAPI with PostgreSQL"
"Deploy a Node.js app to AWS"
```

**Less Effective:**
```
"Build a form"
"Make an API"
"Deploy my app"
```

### 2. Let Experts Coordinate
For complex projects, let the system coordinate multiple experts:
```
You: "Build a full-stack social media app"
System: [Coordinates frontend + backend + database + deployment]
```

### 3. Use ULTRATHINK for Deep Analysis
When you need comprehensive analysis:

**Solution**:
- Use different technology keywords
- Start new conversation thread
- Explicitly mention new domain: "Now I need Python help..."

### Agency Coordination Not Working
**Issue**: Only one expert responds

### 2. Technology Stack Mentions
Be explicit about your stack:
```
"React + Node.js + PostgreSQL"
"Vue + Python + MongoDB"
"Angular + Java + MySQL"
```

### 3. Evolution Planning
